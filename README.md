 Hardware is made up of input devices, the CPU, RAM, processor chip, and input devices such as .
Central Processing Unit (CPU): Often referred to as the brain of the computer, the CPU performs calculations and executes instructions. It processes data and controls the overall operation of the computer.

Memory (RAM): Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of volatile memory that temporarily stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly. RAM allows for faster data access compared to storage devices like hard drives or SSDs.

Storage Devices: These devices are used to permanently store data. Common types include Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), Solid State Drives (SSDs), and increasingly, NVMe SSDs. These store operating systems, applications, and user data.

Motherboard: The motherboard is the main circuit board that holds and connects the CPU, memory, storage, and other essential components of the computer. It facilitates communication between all the components.

Power Supply Unit (PSU): The PSU converts electrical power from an outlet into a form that the computer's components can use. It supplies power to the motherboard, CPU, storage devices, and other components.

Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): The GPU is responsible for rendering graphics and accelerating tasks related to image and video processing. It's particularly important for gaming, video editing, and other graphics-intensive applications.

Input/Output (I/O) Devices: These devices allow users to interact with the computer. Examples include keyboards, mice, monitors, printers, and speakers.

Cooling System: Computers generate heat during operation, especially the CPU and GPU. Cooling systems, including fans, heat sinks, and sometimes liquid cooling solutions, help dissipate this heat to prevent overheating and maintain optimal performance.

Expansion Cards: These are additional circuit boards that can be inserted into expansion slots on the motherboard to add functionality such as networking (Ethernet or Wi-Fi), sound cards, or additional USB/Firewire ports.

Operating System (OS): The OS is software that manages computer hardware and provides a user interface for interacting with the computer. Examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, and various Unix-based systems.

These components work together to enable the functionality of a computer, from processing data and running applications to interacting with users and storing information.
