# Data Professionals Guide
Before you invest any of your time diving into the latest industry buzzwords (during my time it was "Big Data" and "Python"), there are fundamental concepts you'll need to learn. Each concept is outlined below.

## üñ•Ô∏è Computer Science
Computers are made up of hardware and software.

<br/>
Hardware are the physical components of the computer.<br />
<br/>

1.	Motherboard: Main circuit board that holds, connects, and allows communication between major components of the computer (CPU, memory, and storage).
2.	Central Processing Unit (CPU): Terforms calculations and executes instructions. It processes data and controls the overall operation of the computer.
3.	Random Access Memory (RAM): stores data as volatile memory, temporary data storage, used for faster data access.
4.	Storage devices such as SDD, HDD, and NVMe SSD permanently stores data such as operating systems, applications, and user files. Operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.
5.	Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) handles graphic related work such as image and videos for graphic based apps used for gaming and video editing.
6.	Power Supply Unit (PSU) converts electricity and controls voltage to power the computer.
7.	The Cooling System is a CPU cooler that helps dissipate heat from the CPU to prevent overheating.
8.	Input/Output (I/O) Devices such as display monitors, keyboard, mouse, printers, and speakers.
9.	Additional expansion cards such as sound cards, or additional USB ports.
