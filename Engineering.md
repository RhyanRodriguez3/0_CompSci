# Engineering Guide
- Engineering is problem solving. They work in teams and use science and mathematics as tools to solve problems. 
- To solve a probelm you have to understand the problem. Break the problem down into smaller units. Then analyze each of those units and identify properties. Its all about being clever.
- Engineering was created for military engineering and civil for civilian purposes. Mechanical engineering focuses on machines. The four main brances of engineering are civil, mechanical, electrical, and chemical.
- How to build things, design things, and solve problems.

## Civil Engineering
- Civil engineering focuses on structures and buildings. Structural engineering focuses more on the design and framework of structures while construction engineering is more involved with actually building the structure. Think aqueducts, bridges, streets, sewage, supply transportation, buildings, and sanitation.

## Mechanical Engineering
-  field of engineering that focuses on the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of machines and mechanical systems. (wheels, engines, robots, )
-  Biomechanics focus on stress, load, and impact.

## Electrical Engineering
- The field of electricity and electromagnetism. There are three main branches, telecommunications, power and lighting, and computer engineering.
- electrical conduction is the movement of electrically charged particles through a transmission medium.
- Telecommunications requires sending physical lines to places for sound to travel through.
- Electromagnetic waves could carry a signal by modifying their wavelength, amplitude, and frequency.
- Computers were orignally designed to process the signals of radar, radio, and ealry television.

## Chemical Engineering
- focused not only on chemicals and developing and designing plants and processes for manufacturing chemicals.
- A plant is made up of unit operations such as pipes (which transfer materials from one side of the plant to another), pump (which drive the flow of the pipes), reactors (which stimulate a reaction), mixer, distillation (which seperates them).
- The machinery of unit of operations are based on basic principles of momentum transfer, mass transfer, and thermodynamics.
- Main sources of power are petroleum, natural gas, coal, nuclear electic power, and renewable energy (wind, hydroelectric, biofuels, wood, geothermal, solar, and biomass waste).

## Biomedical & Industrial Engineering
- Industrial Engineering focuses on the workers, materials, energy flow, and communication needed to provide the best product or service. All about optimization, the improvement of processes in quality, delivery-time, and cost.
- Biomedical engineering focuses on advancements that improve our health, from diagnosis and analysis of medical conditions, to their treatment and recovery.
