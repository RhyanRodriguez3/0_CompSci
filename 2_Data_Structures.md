# Data Structures Guide
PURPOSE
SUMMARY

## What are Data Structures
- A data structure is a way to store, organize, and manage data in a way that allows the programmer to easily access or modify the values within them. An algorithm is the process of searching and modifying the data structure. There are multiple data structures and each have their own use case.
- BigO Notation are measurements used to assess how efficient a data structure is at accessing, inserting, searching, and modifying elements. The lower the BigO notation the better.  
- BigO notations is measured by time complexity equations, which works by inserting the size of the dataset as an integer, and returns the number of operations processed by the computer before the function can finish. Also consider the worst case scenario when judging data structures. Equations below.
   - O(log n) gets more efficient as the sice of the data set increases. Ex: Binary Search
   - O(n) the graph of volume of data versus instructions needed for this function is linear meaning that for every element you add to the data set the amount of instructions needed to complete that function will increase by the same amount. Operations required 50 and size of data set 50.
   - O(n log n) Not efficient. as the size of the data set increases instead the slope actually increases as the volume of data does. Graph is an increasing slope.
   - 0(n2) and (211) Inefficient, and exponential slope. 



## Basic Data structures
1. Arrays and ArrayLists
   - An array is a list of similar values that can store anything, but stores values of the same type. Parallel arrays are two or more arrays which contain the same number of elements that have corresponding values in the same position.
   - Elements are the individual items stored in the array.
   - An array has 3 attributes, a name, a type, and a size. In an array, it has to store all type of the same type of information. It's size refers to the total mount of elemtns tat are able to be stored within the array and cannot be changed.
   - There are two different ways to create an array in most languages, you can populate the array with elements or you can set a specific size for the array to populate it later.
 
## Intermediate Data structures
- Stacks
- Queue
- Linked Lists
- Dictionary
## Advanced Data structures
- Tree-based
- Tries
- Heaps
- Graphs
