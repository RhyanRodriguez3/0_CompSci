### The computer
- Programming is the process of preparing an instructional program for a device. Attempting to get a computer to  complete a specific task without making mistakes.  
- The computer only understands machine code, which is binary code. You need to convert your instructions for the machien to execute it. Programming languages are fundamentally a middleman for translating a  program into machine code. they serve as interprets for converting languages into other languages.
- There are many programming languages and each have their own specific uses, general purpose languages like pythong and Java can perform a variety of computational tasks and other languages are for specific tasks. Low  low level programming languages, such as assembly, or C, are closer to binary than  a high level programming language, such as Java or Python.

## Coding
- And IDE is a place to write, run, and debug code and convert it to machine code.

- a computer it's just a piece of tape that holds ones and zeros along with a device that can read and write to it it's called a turing machine
- The core of modern computers we have the central processing unit made up of silicon transistors, microscopic on/off switches that trasnmit binary code.
- Declaring a variables, where you attach a name to a data point, allowing you to reuse it somewhere else in your code.
- Data structures are organized data. Arrays organize multiple data points in order. 
- Algorithms are code that solve a problem by doing something to the data structure. A fundamental algorithm is a function: which is a block of code tht takes an input then does something and returns an output.
- Arguments are input parameters.
- Operators are used to compare values.
- Booleans are expression. Expressions produce a value.
- A statement is a block of code that simply does something. For example, If statements, Loop statements,
   - A while loop will run this block of code over and over again until the condition in the parentheses becomes false
   - A for loop continues for each item of something
- Recursions are functions that call themselves.
- A base condition will terminate the loop. 
- The idea behind OOP is that you use classes to write a blueprint for the data or objects in your code a class can encapsulate variables which are commonly called properties as well as functions 
which are usually called methods

## Fundamental Concepts of Object Oriented Programming
- APIE: are the four pillars of object oriented programming. 
- Abstraction means to simplify reality. For example, if you were designing an app you simplify / break down the smalled bits of data about the thing you want to recreate. Taking real world objects and 
and representing them within code.
- OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. 
   - Objects contain data in the form of attributes or properties and actions in thr form or functions or methods. For example, computer monitor (object), size or resolution (properties), on/off brightness is functions or methods.
   - Abstraction  means to only show the necessary details to the user of the object. You only care about calling the method, not the underlying implementation.
   - Inhertiance, useful when you have an existing class and you want to build a new class that uses the stuff from the previous class but you want to add additional features.
   - Encapsulation, restircting access to properties or methods of your object, to prevent 
 

- abstraction means to simplify reality and focus only on the data and processes that are relevant to the application being built.
- encapsulation means that data and the programs that manipulate those data are bound together and their complexity is hidden
- inheritance means that a class can derive its methods and properties from another class this might result in an extensive hierarchy of superclasses and subclasses
- polymorphism means that different subclasses of the same superclass which therefore share the same interface can implement those interfaces in their own ways by overriding the code of the methods they inherit. Akkiws you to  you to determine what kind of function to run while the program is running. For example, the class is enemy (contains code), inheritance is making a vampire using that class, 
- Objects are the thing that you want to store and process data about.
- To program objects, you need a class. A class is a template for creating objects. It is an instance of a class in the computer's memory. For example, person.
- Attributes describe the object aka fields / properties. For example, person firsName, Gener, DOB
- Operations are actions that can be done to the object or performed by the object. Aka methods: programs within the class that are coded as procedures or functions.
- Encapsulation : Hides the data and complexity. Intended to hide and prevent errors. Senior programmers create classes of libraries where junior coders use and need the class name, properties, and methods available.
- Inheritance: A class can derive its methods and properties from another class. Inheritance defines type of relationships. The base class is the start of the hiearchy, sublasses derived from, and
- Polymorphism means that a class can implement an inherited method in its own way

To be a good programmer, don't focus on remembering syntax, recognize patterns.  
Be a problem solver: Solve a bunch of problems / practice
Feynman learning technique: 
(1) Choose a topic
(2) Explain it to a 12 yr old
(3) Build something quickly, then improve after. Reflect, refine, simplify
(4) Organize and review. Share with someone more experienced then you

## Programming Fundementals Overview
My SUMMARY: The levels of languages. He used a few key terms I'll have ot further define such as general programming language. Complied 
- A computer doesn't directly understand javascript or c-sharp, it has to be compiled into something that the CPU understands. There are levels to programming languages, think of it as a scale from what humans write vs what the machine understands. The levels from bottom to top are
  - Hardware (bottom), to Machine language (Binary code), to assembly language, to general purpose languages like C C++ Rust, to interpreted languages (Python, C#, JAVA, JS)
      - C is a general purpose compiled proecural language. C++ is OOP that has more tools than C.
      - Rust Lang is modern low level language used for web and game development.
      - Java is a high level class based language. OOP. This language is compiled to bytecode for the Hava Virtual Machine (JVM).
      - Python is an interpreted language. Ruby is similar to python. Javascript is web browser language.
  - Compiled means a compiler translates the source code for the CPU to execute. Intepreted means a program, called an interpreter, run the code through a virtual machine like Python.
`Functions` are methods
`Objects` are classes that have variables, also called properties
