# Programming Language Guide
- Purpose: to be a good enough programmer to qualify for junior BI dev roles.


## Programming Fundementals Overview
- A computer doesn't directly understand javascript or c-sharp, it has to be compiled into something that the CPU understands. There are levels to programming languages, think of it as a scale from what humans write vs what the machine understands. The levels from bottom to top are
  - Hardware (bottom), to Machine language (Binary code), to assembly language, to general purpose languages like C C++ Rust, to interpreted languages (Python, C#, JAVA, JS)
      - C is a general purpose compiled proecural language. C++ is OOP that has more tools than C.
      - Rust Lang is modern low level language used for web and game development.
      - Java is a high level class based language. OOP. This language is compiled to bytecode for the Hava Virtual Machine (JVM).
      - Python is an interpreted language. Ruby is similar to python.
  - Compiled means a compiler translates the source code for the CPU to execute. Intepreted means a program, called an interpreter, run the code through a virtual machine like Python.
`Functions` are methods
`Objects` are classes that have variables, also called properties

To be a good programmer, don't focus on remembering syntax, recognize patterns.  
Be a problem solver: Solve a bunch of problems / practice
Feynman learning technique: 
(1) Choose a topic
(2) Explain it to a 12 yr old
(3) Build something quickly, then improve after. Reflect, refine, simplify
(4) Organize and review. Share with someone more experienced then you
